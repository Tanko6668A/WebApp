# Inspiration: 
This Webapp is inspired because the current band system is rather inefficient and it is possible to improve it such that we students can access information more easily
# What it does: 
The Webapp has a login system that only allows band members and has a registration page to allow upcoming members to access the system. Inside, the main page has a list of files that links to the pieces we will play for the next few concerts. From there, band members can add files that link to the pieces or request an item to the person restocking the items
# How It Is Made
Flask with jinja for frontend
Sqlite for database
# Challenges
It is my first time creating a webapp and deploying it and coming up with ideas was difficult
